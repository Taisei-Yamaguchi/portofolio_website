                    <p>&nbsp;I believe that the advancement of IT technology is essential in making people's lives more convenient and comfortable.
                    The first time I directly encountered IT technology was when I entered the university research lab in my fourth year.
                    I have always been conscious of time, as I didn't like wasting time on things that would be unproductive.
                    In that sense, I think IT technology is invaluable.
                    <br>&nbsp;In the world of research, it is common to use programming languages for data analysis in any field.
                    I am no exception, as I have used Python, R, and MATLAB for analyzing experimental data.
                    Through that, I experienced the sense of streamlining tasks using IT technology, which sparked my strong interest.
                    As I delved deeper, I discovered the field of web development, which is widely used in our daily lives.
                    As someone who always challenges things of interest, I pursued learning and development in this field,
                    and I became passionately engrossed like never before.
                    <br>&nbsp;In the past, I made decisions about my university and major without much thought.
                    I had good grades and put in more effort than others, but when asked if that was truly what I wanted to do, I couldn't answer with a definite "Yes."
                    During my undergraduate years, I studied various subjects such as biology, real estate, accounting, finance, psychology, law, and obtained various certifications
                    (a small brag: apparently, it's quite difficult to pass the real estate certification exam, but I managed to do it).
                    Still, my future was uncertain, and I was contemplating whether I should follow the usual path of going to graduate school and getting a regular job.
                    However, my perspective changed drastically in the year just before going to graduate school.
                    <br>&nbsp;I wholeheartedly dedicated myself to extracurricular activities, academics (biology), and certification exams.
                    It is because of that, I can confidently declare my determination to pursue the path of an engineer.
                    I want to become an engineer who never forgets the motto of making people's lives more convenient and contribute to society.
