                    <p>&nbsp;
                        In elementary school, I took various lessons, including swimming, piano, and track and field.
                        <br>In middle school, I wanted to continue running track, but since there was no track team, he joined the tennis club instead.
                        <br>In high school, I joined the track team and devoted my youth to club activities and studying.
                        <br>Even at the university where I was accepted on my first-choice, I am equally diligent in club activities and academics.
